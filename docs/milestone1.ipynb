    "The derivative is an extremely important mathematical tool with a wide range of applications. Naturally, we would like to compute it as accurately and efficiently as possible.\n",
    "Two classical methods of calculating the derivative have clear shortcomings. Symbolic differentiation will be accurate, but can be quite expensive computationally. The finite difference method does not have this issue, but will be less precise as different values of epsilon will give different results. This brings us to automatic differentiation, a less costly and more precise approach."
