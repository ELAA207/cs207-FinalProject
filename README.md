## TO DO for Milestone 2
1. Update requirements.txt if there are any new dependencies (as of now it is good to go)
2. Finish documentation in line - descriptions of every method/class/etc.
3. Finish details of Milestone2 document - including description of implementation and use cases. 
4. Test it fully - and write out the testing suite
5. Update the travis.ci to include testing coverage with codecov
6. Make sure to continue to update the released version of our package https://pypi.org/project/autodiff32/ (Ask Erica and Amelia to do this since they are maintainers for the PyPi released package)
